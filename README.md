Cloud Develop Conference @ Columbus, OH
============================================================

This is the result of the demo I showed during my talk, in order to make 
it run you will need to [create a storage account](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/storage/how-to-create-a-storage-account/).

In the ruby folder (`jobs-sample`) you will need to create a file named `keys.rb` that defines `STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `STORAGE_KEY`.

On the Node.js site you will need to define `STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `STORAGE_KEY` somewhere on the code.
